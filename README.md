# Bayesian Earthquake Analysis Tool

Documentation of the current version moved to the pyrocko server can be found here:
https://pyrocko.org/beat/

Based on pyrocko, pytensor and pymc

## News
The new BEAT v2.0.0 is not backward compatible with project setups from BEAT v1.x.x!

## Tutorials
Step by step points on how to use the tool for several scenarios can be found here:
[Examples](https://pyrocko.org/beat/docs/current/examples/index.html#)

**HELP wanted!**

The new release contains a lot of undocumented features a list of these can be found here:
https://github.com/hvasbath/beat/issues/69
However, as this project is mostly the work of a single author it is becoming increasingly difficult to also
write extended pages of tutorials that take days and days of writing. However, as this work is not acknowledged by the
current academic system, I had to decide for a delayed release of the documentation, whenever it will
be available provided by someone. Thus, in case you are willing to contribute I would be more than happy to guide/ support
you in writing parts of the documentation for a particular feature-if you want to try it out.

## Data import
### Geodetic
We recommend to prepare the SAR data (subsampling, data covariance estimation) using KITE (www.pyrocko.org).
kite supports import of ISCE, GAMMA, ROI_Pac and GMTSAR processed interferograms. BEAT then supports import of the native KITE format.

### Seismic
To see a list of the supported data types please see: [Trace Handling](https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/library/examples/trace_handling.html)
In addition to these an ascii text file with the station information is needed of the format::

    #network_name.station_name.location_name latitude[deg] longitude[deg] elevation[m] depth[m]
    IU.TSUM.10            -19.20220       17.58380         1260.0            0.0
      BHE             90              0              1   # channel name azimuth[deg] dip[deg] gain \n
      BHN              0              0              1
      BHZ              0            -90              1
    IU.RCBR.00             -5.82740      -35.90140          291.0          109.0
      BH1             48              0              1
      BH2            138              0              1
      BHZ              0            -90              1
    ...

To ease the creation of this textfile we refer the user to investigate the pyrocko module: model (Function: dump_stations)

In addition to these, BEAT supports the output of the autokiwi package.

Work is in progress to support obspy saved stream and inventory files, as well as stationxml stay tuned ...

Alternatively the seismic data may be saved using the package "pickle" as a file "seismic_data.pkl"
containing a list of 2 lists:
1. list of "pyrocko.trace.Trace" objects alternating for (Z / T / R) rotated traces.
2. list of "pyrocko.model.Station" objects in the same order like the data traces.

We invite the users to propose data formats or outputs of specific programs that they would
like to see implemented.

P.S.: If you came looking for the beat package calculating internet time you can find it [here](https://github.com/tonyskapunk/beat).
