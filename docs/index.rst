Introduction
------------
In crustal deformation studies geophysicists are interested in estimating the
parameters of sources that might be the cause of deformation in the Earth's
crust. These may be for example, movement of fluids (e.g. magma) below a
volcano or the fast movements of one tectonic plate compared to another, also
known as earthquakes. These types of sources can be often approximated by
one or many rectangular dislocations (geometry, position, amount of
dislocation).
With observations at the earth's surface like geodetic data, i.e. deformation
maps from e.g. InSAR or GPS and seismic data i.e. seismic waveforms
from seismic stations, it is possible to estimate the parameters of these
deformation sources.

BEAT is a package that can handle either geodetic and/or seismic data to
estimate source parameters of dislocations in the Earth's crust.
